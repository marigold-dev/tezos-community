All applications manage their own identities or delegate it to a kinda LDAP system. What is important to figure out is that end **users don't want to face non human readable identifiers** (unless pseudonymity is the main purpose).

**TzCommunity offers you, for free, a way to convert identifiers to trustable human readable names, and leverage your role based access system**

- linking your Tezos address is free, no hidden fees, no need to renew, no naming spoilation
- unlinking too
- social account link is trustable, it is based on OAUTH2, noone can impersonate you as we provide you the real provider alias identifier
- you can organize groups and manage your role based access system in your application based TzCommunity organizations
