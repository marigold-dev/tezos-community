# Import wallets

We can go to `Import wallet` to import any existing TzSafe wallet. TzSafe allows us to manage multiple wallets. The currently used wallets can be selected in the menu, as shown by the following figure.

Notice that, even though we are not the owner of a wallet, we can still import it. Not being an owner just means we can’t make or sign proposals for the wallet.&#x20;

The very first step of importing an existing wallet is to fill in its wallet address, and its alias if that's needed. The name can be modified in the `Address book` later. &#x20;

Click `Continue` to go next, it’ll take a few seconds to load the setting of the wallet. Then, we can preview the settings. We can also give an alias to owner addresses in this step.

Finally, save the wallet, and then it should be shown on the sidebar.
